# Autism Detection

## Overview

This Python project implements an autism detection model using LightGBM and scikit-learn libraries. The model is trained on a dataset comprising images of children, including both autistic and non-autistic cases.

## Files

- `autism_detection_model.py`: Main script containing the code for training and evaluating the model.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset of children's images.
- `requirements.txt`: File listing all the required Python packages for running the code.
- `LICENSE`: MIT License for the project.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Place your dataset of children's images in the `data/` directory.
4. Run `autism_detection_model.py` to train and evaluate the model.
5. Customize the model parameters and preprocessing steps as needed.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- LightGBM
- scikit-learn
- PIL (Python Imaging Library)

## Dataset
